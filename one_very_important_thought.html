        <h1>one (oh so) very important thought</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Now that the show is over <br>
            And we have jointly exercised our constitutional rights <br>
            We would like to leave you with one very important thought <br>
            Sometime in the future, you may have the opportunity to serve <br>
            As a juror in a censorship case or a so-called obscenity case <br>
            It would be wise to remember that the same people who would stop you from listening to Boards of Canada <br>
            May be back next year to complain about a book, or even a TV program <br>
            If you can be told what you can see or read <br>
            Then it follows that you can be told what to say or think <br>
            Defend your constitutionally protected rights <br>
            No one else will do it for you <br>
            Thank you <br>
